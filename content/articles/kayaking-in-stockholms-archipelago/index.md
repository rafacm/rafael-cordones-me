I lived for about three years in Stockholm and thus friends who did not take their chance to visit me while I was living there, ask me every now and then which places should they visit when visiting Stockholm. I always end up wrapping a short list of places with a short description in an e-mail. I always end the e-mail saying that to really really visit Stockholm, you have to go at least twice: once in summer and once in winter!

When visiting Stockholm in summer, a place definitely not to miss is the Stockholm’s archipelago! I had the luxury of visiting this August and had the luck of enjoying good weather. If there’s a reason why Stockholm is called “Beauty on water”, when you are out in the archipelago, you understand that reason even more.

<a href="http://www.waxholmsbolaget.com/">Vaxholmsbolaget</a> and <a href="http://www.stromma.nu/">Strömma Kanalbolaget</a> will take you to the main islands in the archipelago.

<p style="text-align: left;">If you take <a href="http://www.vikingline.fi">the ferry to Helsinki</a>, you will also be able to get a great tour through the archipelago.</p>

But given that you are in Sweden, a country with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Sweden"><em>Allemansrätt</em></a>, the best way to enjoy the archipelago is to rent a kayak and make your own way through the myriad islands. Hop on and off and to enjoy the amazing scandinavian sunsets.
