<em>Slow down you crazy child
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you’re so smart tell me why
You are still so afraid?Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day</em><em>But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you an just get old
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you</em>

<em>Slow down you’re doing fine
You can’t be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it’s so romantic on the borderline tonight
Too bad but it’s the life you lead
You’re so ahead of yourself
That you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you’re wrong</em>

<em>But you know you can’t always see when you’re right
You got your passion you got your pride
But don’t you know only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don’t imagine they’ll all come true
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you</em>

<em>Slow down you crazy child
Take the phone off the hook
And disappeaar for a while
It’s alright you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you.</em>
