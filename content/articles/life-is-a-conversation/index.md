>And so it begins, with this post, a new iteration of my personal blog.

<strong>What can to expect in this new iteration?</strong> The <a href="http://rafael.cordones.me/category/photoblog/">photoblog</a> aspect will remain, as before, an important part since photography is one of my favorite hobbies. Nevertheless, this time I will spice it all up with some technical posts on my Java (the ecosystem) interests, experiences and projects I contribute to. I believe that technology alone doesn't take you very far, i.e. technology is always developed and used in a context (people, organization, market, ...) and one should not forget that. Therefore, expect the articles in this post to have a bit more than "just" technical stuff.

<strong>How often?</strong> You should not expect more than one post a month. In any case, I will announce new posts on Twitter, so you can definitely <a href="https://twitter.com/rafacm">follow me</a> on Twitter to get notified.

<strong>New domain?!</strong> Yes! One of the things which took me a while to decide, was whether to stick with the previous domain <code>casadelhuerto.com</code> or again (pronounced alá Forrest Gump) find a new domain name. 
That domain comes from the name of a place called <a href="http://rafael.cordones.me/2010/12/17/casa-del-huerto/">Casa del Huerto</a> (house with a garden) that my family has in the south of Spain. A place I try to visit and enjoy at least once a year. About a week ago, I happened to come across <a href="http://dabblet.com/">Dabblet</a>, a great project from <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a> and it suddenly striked me that there's no better name for a personal blog than my own name! I quickly checked the availabilty of <code>cordones.me</code> and BINGO! I had it. Thanks Lea!

<strong>Feedback?</strong> Yes... and much appreciated! And brutal (constructive) feedback encouraged... it's one of the best ways to improve... fast!

<h2>The Making-of</h2>

Some implementation notes of this new version of the blog:

<strong>Blog engine:</strong> definitely WordPress! Why? Because even if, as a Java (ecosystem) developer I was really, really tempted to go the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a> route or even taste some of that <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> super-heroic JavaScript elixir... to my knowledge, nothing beats WordPress sheer ecosystem size of plugins, short-codes, ... you name it!

Yes! I agree that the authoring experience on WordPress is a PITA but the publishing experience (SEO plugins, RSS feed generation, ...) is top-noch. 

These are the main plugins I am using (so far) in this website:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Crayon Syntax Highlighter:</strong> for source code syntax highlighting (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/">website</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>Disqus Comment System:</strong> for the comments on posts (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">website</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>Ultimate Maintenance Mode:</strong> to display a background image and an overlayed window with a message while the site is down (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ultimate-maintenance-mode/">plugin website</a>).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Theme:</strong> since a mobile-friendly version of my blog was a MUST and I have gained some experience in the past year using Twitter Bootstrap and I like it quite a bit, I settled for the <a href="http://www.rootstheme.com/">Roots WordPress theme</a> on top of which I added my own customizations. My changes can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rafacm">my GitHub space</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/rafacm/roots/tree/rafael.cordones.me">"rafael.cordones.me" branch</a>.

<strong>Typography:</strong> looking for a close cousin of <a href="http://www.helveticafilm.com/">Helvetica</a>, I ended up finding the <a href="http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/">Lato Font</a> via <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/#UsePlace:use/Collection:Lato">Google Web Fonts</a>. Created by <a title="The Team" href="http://www.latofonts.com/team/">Łukasz Dziedzic</a><strong>.</strong>

<strong>Icon sets:</strong> <a href="http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/2009/06/social_media_icons/">Social Media Icons</a> by <a href="http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/">Paul Robert Lloyd</a> and <a href="http://ciorici.com/">Pavel Ciorici</a>'s <a href="http://www.wpzoom.com/freebies/">WPZOOM Social Networking Icon Set</a>.

<strong>Photos:</strong> unless explicitly stated otherwise, <a href="http://rafael.cordones.me/category/photoblog/">all photos in this blog</a> are <em>created</em> by me. The squared ones with the border around are done with my iPhone with the <a href="http://hipstamatic.com/">Hipstamatic</a> app. While the technical quality of the pictures one can take with a smartphone is far from that of DSLR cameras, there is nothing like a smartphone (which we always carry around) to <em>capture moments in time</em>. In a certain way, using <a href="http://hipstamatic.com/">Hipstamatic</a> is for me to pay homage to one of the masters: <a href="http://photography-now.net/jacques_henry_lartigue/portfolio1.html">Jacques-Henri Lartigue</a>.

<h2>Postscript</h2>
Last but not least, music is also a very important part of my life and wanted to credit the song that set the <em>Stimmung</em> for this post and, hopefully, for the new iteration of my blog... it's all <a href="https://soundcloud.com/robotaki">robotaki</a>'s fault:
