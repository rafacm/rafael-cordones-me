Call me Rafael. [I'm from Barcelona](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wi1d0FNgdQ). I studied Computer Engineering at [BarcelonaTech](http://www.upc.edu/) which I left more than a decade ago to finish my Master's degree at [KTH](http://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm. After living in Stockholm for a few years and [rejoice in its endless archipelago](http://rafael.cordones.me/2008/08/22/kayaking-in-stockholms-archipelago/) during summer, I moved to Dublin where I worked for a couple of years [enjoying long weekend getaways](/2008/03/16/hike-in-glendalough-ireland/). In 2008 I moved back to the continent, [to Vienna](/2008/07/11/vienna/), where I have now pretty much settled down to enjoy Vienna's _Gemütlichkeit_ and its many [Heurigen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuriger) in spring and summer.

I consider myself full-stack software developer with most of my experience in the Java field. Java is for me more than a language. It's an ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, virtual machine, opinionated ways of doing things ([I'm looking at you Maven](http://rafael.cordones.me/2013/05/06/maven-and-gradle-walk-into-a-bar/)) and other languages too ([now I'm looking at you Scala](http://meetup.scala-vienna.org)). With the term "full-stack developer", I mean that for me, the business value of the product or project goes on top of the technology stack. Paraphrasing Jamie Zawinski, [I don't get up every morning to write code; I'd rather focus on shipping stuff](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html).

Since the (hidden) complexity of most software projects lies in understanding the business domain and getting all project participants to reach [a common understanding](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html), I have a passion for [whole‑team specification involvement](http://specificationbyexample.com/), [business processes as first‑class application citizens](http://camunda.org/) and application [integration](http://camel.apache.org/) [frameworks](http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration).

All of this sustained by a [music-driven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQsM6u0a038#t=07m03s) software development implementation.

I believe myself inoculated against the [Not Invented Here syndrome](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-invented-here-Syndrom) preferring instead to fully embrace a Proudly Found Elsewhere attitude.

I love good stories in any form and shape (music, films, comics, books, paintings, photos, ...) and my main hobbies are [photography](http://rafael.cordones.me/category/photoblog/), in-line skating and putting lots of hyperlinks in the texts that I post on this website.
