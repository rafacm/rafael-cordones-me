I lived for about three years in Stockholm, and thus friends who did not take their chance to visit me while I was living there, ask me every now and then which places should they visit when visiting Stockholm. I always end up wrapping a short list of places with a short description in an e-mail. I always end the e-mail saying that to really really visit Stockholm, you have to go at least twice: once in summer and once in winter!

When visiting Stockholm in summer, a place definitely not to miss is the Stockholm's archipelago! I had the luxury of visiting this August and had the luck of enjoying good weather. If there's a reason why Stockholm is called "Beauty on water", when you are out in the archipelago, you understand that reason even more.

[Vaxholmsbolaget](http://www.waxholmsbolaget.com/) and [Strömma Kanalbolaget](http://www.stromma.nu/) will take you to the main islands in the archipelago.

If you take [the ferry to Helsinki](http://www.vikingline.fi/), you will also be able to get a great tour through the archipelago.

But given that you are in Sweden, a country with [*Allemansrätt*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Sweden), the best way to enjoy the archipelago is to rent a kayak and make your own way through the myriad islands. Hop on and off and to enjoy the amazing scandinavian sunsets.

## Top 5 Songs for a visit to Stockholm's Archipelago

1. [Bo Kaspers Orkester](http://www.bokaspers.com/)'s "[Semester](http://www.youtube.com/v/iI0VEeGbvMk).
2. [Marie Fredriksson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Fredriksson)'s (internationally, of Roxette fame) "[Äntligen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w67-lbGtM4E)".
3. [Monica Zetterlund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Zetterlund)'s delicate rendering of [Bill Evans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans)' classic "Waltz for Debby": "[Monicas Vals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tp-nbchmHU)".
4. [Lisa Ekdahl](http://lisaekdahl.com/)'s "[Vem Vet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42JOswXMm64)".
5. This last one is for the way back, on the plane. Start playing it just after the flight pilot says "Please, fasten your seat-belts!"... "[The Final Countdown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw)" by [Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_(band)).
